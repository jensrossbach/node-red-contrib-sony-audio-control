# node-red-contrib-sony-audio-control
A collection of Node-RED nodes to control Sony audio devices via the Sony Audio Control API.

With these nodes you can connect to your Sony audio devices and send control commands (like powering on/off, change volume etc.), retrieve information (like the current volume, the current value of a sound setting etc.) or get notified of certain events (like a change of the power state, a change of the mute state etc.).
